            I&apos;m an AI-focused full-stack engineer with multiple systems live in production. Over the past three years, I&apos;ve shipped and operated products handling large data volumes, reduced operational costs by 95%, and maintained the infrastructure myself.
            <br /><br />
            I specialize in turning complex AI pipelines into reliable software retrieval, vector storage, and model orchestration optimized for low latency (sub-200ms), high accuracy (94%+), and real production constraints.
            <br /><br />
            I&apos;m seeking a full-time role at an early-stage startup where execution matters and engineers are trusted to ship systems that deliver measurable business value.
